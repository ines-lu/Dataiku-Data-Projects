Here is the Project 2 Online_Retailer. 

# Project Description
This project operates within the context of an online retailer seeking to leverage data science to optimize its marketing strategy. The initiative involves integrating heterogeneous data sources—including internal CRM data, web traffic logs, and external economic data (GDP per capita)—to create a unified view of customer behavior. The project transitions from raw data engineering to predictive modeling, culminating in a dashboard that displays both performance metrics and actionable business insights.

# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a regression model to predict the "lifetime value" (revenue) a new customer will generate for the company.

Secondary objectives include:
- Identifying key drivers of revenue (feature importance) to guide marketing actions.
- Providing data-driven recommendations, such as specific demographic or geographic targets, to maximize sales.
